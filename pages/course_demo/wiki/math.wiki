== testing the < math > tag ==

Some formulas are displayed with HTML.
(The top line has extra spaces in the math tag
to keep it from doing its thing and leave TeX is visible.)
 < math > y = \alpha + \beta < /math >
 <math> y = \alpha + \beta </math>

Others will display with a png image.
In either case, the software should do the
right thing automatically.
 < math >x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}< /math >
 <math>x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}</math>

<math> \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\alpha}} </math>


== other ways ==

There are a few other ways to input other characters, too:
HTML special symbols (e.g. "& alpha ;" without
the spaces and utf-8 characters.  How this shows up
for you will depend on your browser and available fonts.

Here's the lowercase greek alphabet in utf-8 character.<br>
(I used the Mac "Show Keyboard Palette" under "Keyboard"
to type the characters.)<p>

α β γ δ ε ζ η θ ι κλ μ ν ξο π ρ σ ς τ υ φ χ ψ ωϑ ϒ ϕ ϖ 

Or using HTML symbols (e.g. "& alpha ;" without the spaces).

α β γ ...

or within individual math tags

<math>\alpha</math> <math>\beta</math> <math>\gamma</math> ...

or all in one tag

<math> \alpha \beta \gamma </math>
