Under Construction
------------------

Lots more coming eventually .... if in doubt, ask [Jim](mailto:mahoney@marlboro.edu).

The [old help pages](https://cs.marlboro.college/courses/help/) might also be of some use.

Editing pages
-------------

Log in first using the link at the top right of the window.

If you're able to edit a page, you'll see an "edit" tab near the top of the window. 

The pages here use <b>[markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)</b> for text formatting, similar to github.

    
Typesetting Math
----------------

You can also input LaTeX for math symbols and formulas.

Expressions on one line such as \( e^{-i\pi} \) are put within backslash parens.

Or put the equation on it's own line with two dollar signs or backslash brackets, like this

$$ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2 a} $$

or this

\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} = \infty \]
