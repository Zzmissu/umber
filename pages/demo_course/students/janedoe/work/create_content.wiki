Here I am logged in as Jane Doe, submitting an assignment.

But as Jane, I can't create a page in the home directory
the way a faculty could.  So this is a silly assignment...

<red>Hi Jane.  Ted Teacher here.  I see that you put something
in, and agree that's all you could do.  Catch you in class.</red>
