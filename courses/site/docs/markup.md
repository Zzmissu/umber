Markup Syntax
=============

You can edit umber pages using [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and [html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) with snips of [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) for math.

The rules are :

* Plain text is wrapped. Blank lines indicate paragraphs.
* Links are made with brackets and parens :&#91;displayed text&#93;(url)
* Heading and sub-headings are marked with either # or ## or by underlining with == or -- .
* Bullet lists have a * for each a line - and leave a blank line before and after the list.
* Horizontal lines are given by ----- .
* Block quotes in which whitespace is unchanged are indented four spaces. 
* Code blocks with syntax highlights are created with triple ticks, [as on github](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/).
* Math LaTeX inline expressions are delimited with slash parens, e.g. `\(  e^\pi \)` while equations on their own line should be placed between bracket parens e.g. `\[ x = \frac{1}{1+x} \]`
