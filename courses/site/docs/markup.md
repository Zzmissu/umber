Markup Syntax
=============

You can edit umber pages using [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and [html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) with snips of [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) for math.

jumps over the lazy dog.```

* Create links with &#91;displayed text&#93;(url).
* Underline headings and subheadings with equal signs and dashes.
* Put an asterisk at the start of a line to make a bullet list. (And leave a blank line before and after the list.)
* Text that is indented with four spaces or is between backticks is put a yellowish block withou line wrapping, `like  this    block`
* LaTeX inline expressions go within slash parens, e.g. `\(  e^\pi \)` while equations on their own line go within bracket parens e.g. `\[ x = \frac{1}{1+x} \]`
* Code blocks marked with triple ticks will have syntax highlights, [as on github](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/).
