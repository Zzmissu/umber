Umber is a course management software system ... but you probably already knew that. :)

Formerly known as "wikiacademia", it's been in use by the natural science faculty at <a href="https://www.marlboro.edu">Marlboro College</a> since 2010 for some of the courses there, such as the recent Marlboro computer science courses at <a href="https://cs.marlboro.college">https://cs.marlboro.college</a> .

Check out its <a href="https://github.com/jimmahoney/umber">github repo</a> for all the details.
