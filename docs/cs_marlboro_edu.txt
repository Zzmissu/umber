replication of course database from cs.marlboro.edu
public content as static site

 csmarlboro.org running at linode
   / is 47G with 30G available
   /home has 3.6G

 The current linode is 4GB Ram / 48GB SSD / 2 cores @ $240/yr

 Could upgrade to 8GB / 96 GB SSD / 4 cores for $480/yr

 Or add "block storage" : 1 to 1024G , $0.10/G/mo
 So 32GB would cost $ 3.20 * 12 = $38/yr
 Created volume "umber".
 Followed instructions at linode manager to set it up

   $ mkfs.ext4 /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_umber
   $ mkdir /var/www/umber
   $ mount /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_umber /var/www/umber
   --- /etc/fstab ---
   /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_umber /var/www/umber ext4 defaults 0 2


 I want to replicate this web tree :
    http://cs.marlboro.edu/courses/
    which is 45G (according to "du -sh .")
    ... but not the student work which
    I think is a big chunk of that.

 with I think this tool 
    wget
      --timestamping
      --wait=1         1sec delay between requests
      --recursive
      --no-parent
      --level=inf      (which is what they have for --mirror)
      --quota=inf
      --append-file=...    set log file
 
 $ at -f scriptfilename now

 which I think will get me a static set of html files
 that can be used as an archive of those past courses
 with most of the content without the wikiacademia software.

 --------

 1st attempt completed after only a few hours,
 not sure where (if) log was written.
 
 About 1G was downloaded - some of it looks OK,
 some (for example notes/* files in at least one course).
 Edited the script a bit & tried again, with a log file ...
 will at it after this one finieshes too.

 The files (and links I'm afraid) are going to
 need some cleanup in any case, it looks like.

--------------------------------------------

 2nd attempt looks like it may have gone further -
 need to look at what's here more closely and
 do some pruning and/or adjustments.
