Markup Syntax
=============

You can edit umber pages using [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and [html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) with snips of [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) for math.

The basics are:

* Leave blank lines between paragraphs.
* Create links with &#91;displayed text&#93;(url).
* Underline headings and subheadings with equal signs and dashes.
* Put an asterisk at the start of a line to make a bullet list. (And leave a blank line before and after the list.)
* Indent text with four spaces to put it in a yellowish block and turn off line wrapping.
* LaTeX inline expressions go within slash parens, e.g. &#92;(  e^[pi] &#92;) .
* LaTeX equations on their own line go within bracket parens, e.g. &#92;[  e^[pi] &#92;].

Examples are given in the table below.
